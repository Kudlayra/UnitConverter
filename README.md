Unit Converter â€” KMP Project with Compose Multiplatform 

This is a Unit Converter application developed using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform for the user interface. The project enables users to convert values between various units of measurement using a unified codebase that covers UI, business logic, and network operations.

Technologies:

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP): Used for shared business logic, data handling, and network requests across Android, iOS, and other potential platforms.

Compose Multiplatform: Enables building a declarative user interface from a shared Kotlin codebase, delivering native look and performance on supported platforms.

Ktor Client: Used to perform asynchronous network requests (e.g. fetching updated units) from common Kotlin code.

Room: Serves as the local database for storing units of measurement and associated information.
